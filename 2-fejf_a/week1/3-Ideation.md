# Ideation: Objectives and Outcomes

The first step in your journey towards the implementation of the Capstone project begins with an `idea`.

In this module you will

- Develop the `idea` for your project, the set of expected `features`, survey the market to look at similar ideas to enable you to differentiate your project from others, while at the same time drawing inspiration from them.

You are required to submit a `formal ideation report` following the structure given in the `template`. This will enable your peers to provide you feedback and suggestions for your project.

Before you __get started__ on a project, the first step is to __develop__ the `idea` for the project. In this module you will explore _how you develop your idea_ and _come up with possible set of features for your project_. At the end of this step you should be able to:

- _Clearly_ __express__ the `central idea` of your project, and __identify__ the problem being addressed
- __Delineate__ a `set of features` that you expect your website and app should support
- __Identify__ other projects that might have _similar_ features and would act as exemplars for your project
