# UI Design and Prototyping: Objectives and Outcomes

Now that you are more clear about your `project idea`, it's time to conceive _how your project is going to look like for the `end-users`_.

This is the time to __design__ the `user interface` and the `flow of your application`.

`User interface design` and `prototyping` helps you to _conceptualize_ the look and feel of your application. This _can be achieved_ in __two__ ways: using `wireframe diagrams`, or using `prototyping` tools.

We provide links to `wireframing` and `prototyping` tools in the _additional resources_.

The focus in this lesson is to be able to _visually_ represent various `UI` elements to enable designing your application.

The aim is to __deliver__ an _reasonable_ `representation` of the _end-user_ `experience` with your application.

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- __Construct__ a `wireframe diagram` to visually represent the structure of your `user interface`
- __Construct__ a `prototype` to enable understanding the `flow` of your application

## UI Design and Prototyping Report Template

Project Title

1. Introduction

- [] Give a brief introduction to your project and the list of features.
- [] Summarize in a few sentences what you proposed in the ideation report.

2. User Interface Design and Prototype

- [] Give some sample user interface layouts for your application. You can use either wireframe diagrams or prototyping tools to construct the mock representations of your UI design
- [] Briefly explain the rationale behind designing your UI and how it is geared towards supporting the list of features for your application.

3. Navigation Structure

- [] Give a brief overview of the navigation structure for your application.
- [] Briefly indicate a typical flow of your application in terms of user experience. You can use any way of representing the flow. You can also construct a prototype using one of the prototyping tools to illustrate this.

4. References

- [] Provide any references relevant to the report

## Peer-graded Assignment: UI Design and Prototyping

In this assignment you will be submitting a `written report` that includes some _user interface designs_ and the _flow_ of your application and the navigation structure.

The report should follow the report template structure given earlier in this lesson.

### Review criteria

Your submission will be reviewed based on the following criteria by peers in order to provide you with constructive feedback on your project idea:

1. Does the report provide a brief overview of the project and the list of features ?
2. Does the report contain some user inteface designs that showcase the realization of the features listed above?
3. Does the report contain information about the application flow and navigation structure?
4. Does the report provide references to suitable sources in support of the project?
