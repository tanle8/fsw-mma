# Data Binding: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson you will:

- learn about __data binding__ and
- how data binding __enables__ the `flow of information` _between the `component` and its `template`_.
- learn about `interpolation`, `property attribute` and `event binding` and the use of `two-way data binding`.

 At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

- Understand how the `data` __flows__ between the `component code` and _its_ `template`
- Understand how `one-way` and `two-way` data binding can be used to effect the __flow of data__.

==============================

If you have a static website, then you have all the data that you need in order to build your website. And it'll  be created once and your website is ready to go.

But many websites these days are driven by data from the backend. Your web application will __fetch__ `data` from the a `backend server` the __use__ the `data` to dynamically layout content on your website, or even update content on your website.

So this requires the `data` to __flow__ from the backend through your web application to the `DOM`. And any user interacts with the DOM should be conveyed back to your web application. So this requires the communication between the `DOM` and your `component` in the angular framework for example

## Data binding

- Mechanism for coordinating between the
    - Template --> DOM
    - Component --> Property

- Data flowing from `component` to `template`
- `Events` generated by user interaction flowing to the component

## Data Binding Summary

| One-way from `data source` to `view target` | `{{expression}}` `[target] = "expression"` `bind-target = "expression"` | Interpolation Property Attribute Class Style | `{{dish.name}}` `[dish] = "selectedDish"` `bind-dish = "selectedDish"` |
| One-way from `view target` to `data source` | `(target) = "statement"` `on-target = "statement"`                      | Event                                        | `(click) = "onSelect(dish)"` `on-click = "onSelect(dish)"`             |
| Two-way                                     | `[(target)] = "expression"` `bindon-target = "expression"`              | Two-way                                      | `[(ngModel)] = "dish.name"`                                            |

### Binding Targets

- Binding targets are the properties that are declared on the _left side_ of the binding declaration (`[...]`, `(...)`, `[(...)]`)

    - Right side of the `=` are the _binding source_ (`"..."`)

- Target properties must be explicitly marked as _Input_ or _Output_ properties using `decorators`:

    - `@Input() dish: Dish;`
    - `@Output() deleteDish = new eventEmiiter<Dish>();`
