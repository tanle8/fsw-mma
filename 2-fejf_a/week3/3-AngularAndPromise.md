# Angular and Promise: Objectives and Outcomes

In this lesson:

- we briefly review JavaScript `promises` and then
- see how we can __redesign__ the `services` to _return_ `promises` instead of returning the `values` _immediately_.

At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

- Get a basic understanding of `JavaScript promises`
- Use `promises` to __enable__ the `services` to function `asynchronously` and return results when available
