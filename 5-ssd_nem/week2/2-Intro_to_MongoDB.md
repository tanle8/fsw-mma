# Introduction to MongoDB

In this lesson you will:

- Learn the basics of MongoDB
- Download and setup MongoDB
- Interact with a MongoDB server using the mongo REPL shell.

At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Explain the _salient features_ of `MongoDB`
- Understand the _difference_ between `SQL` and `NoSQL databases`.
- Download, install and run a MongoDB server and interact with it from the `mongo REPL shell`.

## NoSQL Databases

Four broad categories:

- Document databases (e.g., MongoDB)
- Key-value databases (e.g., Redis)
- Column-family databases (e.g., Cassandra)
- Graph databases (e.g., Neo4J)

## Document Databases

- Document: A self-contained piece of information

    - E.g., a JSON document:

    ```bash
    {
        "name": "Uthapizza",
        "description": "A unique combination ..."
    }
    ```
