# REST API with Express, MongoDB and Mongoose

In this lesson you will integrate the REST API that you developed with the Express framework earlier together with the Mongoose `schemas` and `models` and the MongoDB `database` to provide the complete _end-to-end_ implementation of the server to support REST API.

At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- __Develop__ a _full-fledged_ `REST API server` with `Express`, `MongoDB` and `Mongoose`
- __Implement__ the _end-to-end_ solution integrating `Express`, `Node` and `Mongo`.
