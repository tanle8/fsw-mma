# Express Generator

In this lesson you will:

- Learn about `Express generator`, a scaffolding tool to quickly generate an Express application with typical support for routes.
- Build an `Express server` to support REST API.

At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- _Quickly_ __scaffold out__ a typical Express application using `express-generator`
- __Build__ an `Express server` to support REST API

## Exercise

You will:

- Use the `Express generator` to scaffold out an Express application.
- Modify the application to support REST API making use of the Node modules that you developed as part of the first assignment.

At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

- __Generating__ an _Express application_ using the `express-generator`
- __Modify__ the _Express application_ to support the REST API by adding `routes`

npm install express-generator -g
```

Use _sudo_ if you are using an `OSX` or `Linux` machine.
